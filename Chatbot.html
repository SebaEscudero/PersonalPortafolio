            <h1>Chat Bot Example</h1>
            <p>Like I said in homepage, I've always had an <u>affinity towards technology</u> and lately what's been <U>ITCHING</U> me is learning about AI and how it works.</p>
            <p>One day, I found myself bored and I suddenly remembered that when I had an e-commerce store I would always think to myself:</p>
            <h2>Is there some way to make this customer experience a little bit easier?</h2>
            <p>It used to be very OVERWHELMING when I had to answer so many messages and calls through my phone.</p>

            <p>So I've been researching about ChatBots, how they work, how they can respond to different inputs so quickly.</p>
            <p>I stumbled upon ChatBots made with Watson Assistan technology, and I decided to challenge myself with the task of building a simple test bot.</p>
            <p>After a few days I managed to make my first little ChatBot that simulated customer service in a flower shop based in Vancouver and Montreal, I named the chatbot Florence and connected it to a WordPress webpage, here's a photo with the example of the bot:</p>

            <p>And here's the link to the WordPress page, remember it was an example it only answered basic questions of the simulated WebPage:</p>
